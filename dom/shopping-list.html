<!--Full Disclosure: The MDN Document contains the same exercise as our 
  assignment at the bottom along with a link to the answer. I carefully worked
  through the MDN document including creating files to work through the code 
  examples which I uploaded to github and when I got to the exercise I worked 
  on my code but when I became stuck I studied their answer to better understand 
  what to do. I did not fully rely on it but also surfed online for what I needed
  to understand. I did not copy and paste and I coded my own responses to each 
  step.--
